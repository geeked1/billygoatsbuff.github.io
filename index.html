	<h1>Welcome to Billy Goats Buff!</h1>
	<p>In Billy Goats Buff,
you are playing to survive. You and your goats anxiously await the moment Beatrice the Troll Arrives. During this waiting period you draw cards, and play cards to improve the Buffness of your goat. 
Though watch out! All of your ‘friends’ want to be the last goat standing, and will stop at nothing to do so. They may play negative cards on you to make you weak. Don’t fret too much because you can also play negative cards to make them weak as well.
 When a Troll card is revealed at the top of the deck, Beatrice has arrived and the troll crossing begins.
If players have a Play on X-ing card then you will play before points are added. Once all the cards are in play everyone must add their mod points up. The player with the least amount of mod points is eliminated by Beatrice the troll.
This keeps happening until there is only one goat left standing, and a winner is declared.
