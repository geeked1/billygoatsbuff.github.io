		<p>I am Ashley O’Brien creator and Lead designer of Billy Goats Buff. I am a Senior Communication Design Student. I enjoy playing many board games, card games and video games when I am not working. I am a very competitive person when it comes to games. I spent 4 years studying Music in college when I decided it wasn’t for me. Music is still a big part of my life that I enjoy. </p>
